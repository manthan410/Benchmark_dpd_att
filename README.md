# Towards Benchmarking Design Pattern Detection Under Obfuscation

This repository accompanies the paper:  

**‚ÄúTowards Benchmarking Design Pattern Detection Under Obfuscation: Reproducing and Evaluating Attention-Based Detection Method‚Äù**  
Accepted at **AISA 2025**, co-located with **ECSA 2025**.

## üìÅ Dataset Overview

- **Original Subset**  
  34 Java source files (2‚Äì3 per pattern, covering 13 design patterns including ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù samples), manually curated from the DPD_Att corpus.

- **Obfuscated Subset**  
  The same 34 Java files, systematically obfuscated to remove naming-based syntactic signals (class names, method names, variable names) while preserving program logic, control flow, and inheritance structures.

- **Mapping Files**  
  Obfuscator-generated mapping files to match obfuscated class names back to their original names, enabling reproducibility of labels for evaluation.
